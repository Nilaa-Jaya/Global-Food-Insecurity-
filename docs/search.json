    "text": "1 Introduction\nThis project explores global food insecurity by analyzing data trends and patterns to understand the prevalence and drivers of severe food insecurity across 191 countries. As a critical global challenge shaped by economic, social, and environmental factors, addressing food insecurity is essential for public health, economic stability, and sustainable development.\nUsing the World Food Security Outlook (WFSO) dataset, which integrates data from key sources like FAO, IMF, and FEWS NET, this project examines historical trends, current conditions, and future projections related to severe food insecurity. Advanced machine learning models, such as Cubist regression, enhance data accuracy and provide robust insights into regional disparities and macroeconomic factors influencing food security.\nBy leveraging these analyses, this project aims to contribute to discussions on policy and strategy development, supporting global efforts to reduce hunger and promote sustainable development.",

    "text": "1.1 Background\nFood insecurity is defined as inconsistent access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food for an active, healthy life. Severe food insecurity—where individuals go days without eating—reflects economic instability, social inequality, and environmental challenges. Addressing food insecurity is essential to achieving the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of Zero Hunger by 2030, as it directly impacts poverty, public health, and climate resilience.\nRecent global crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, conflicts in regions like Ukraine, and climate-related disasters, have exacerbated food insecurity. These events highlight the urgency of informed analysis to address this critical challenge.",

    "text": "1.2 Objectives\nThe project aims to uncover meaningful patterns and trends in global food insecurity, guided by the following key questions:\nHow has severe food insecurity evolved globally and regionally from 1999 to the present? Which regions or countries are at the highest risk? How do macroeconomic factors like inflation and economic shocks impact food insecurity? What are the financing needs and demographic trends among food-insecure populations?",

    "text": "2.1.1 Source:\nThe dataset is produced and maintained by the World Bank Development Economics Data Group and the Agriculture Global Practice. It is publicly accessible via the World Bank Microdata Library and an accompanying API for efficient data integration.\n\n\n2.1.2 Description:\nThe dataset comprises 21,010 observations and focuses on key indicators such as the prevalence of severe food insecurity, population sizes of affected individuals, and the financing required to mitigate food insecurity risks. The data integrates multiple authoritative sources, including the FAO, IMF, and FEWS NET, and employs machine learning models to enhance accuracy and provide reliable projections.\n\n\n2.1.3 Variables:\n• iso3c: ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country code identifying each country.\n• country: Full name of the country or territory.\n• indicator_short: A concise identifier for the specific indicator (e.g., “Prevalence”).\n• indicator_long: A detailed description of the indicator being measured.\n• unit: Unit of measurement, such as percentages (%) or monetary values (USD).\n• year: Numeric year associated with the observation, ranging from 1999 to 2028.\n• value: The numeric value of the indicator, representing food insecurity data.\n• flag: A descriptor noting whether the data point is observed, estimated, or modeled.\n• type: Classification of the observation (e.g., historical, preliminary, or forecast).\n• note: Supplementary details about the data point, such as methodology or context.\n• estimated: A binary indicator specifying whether the value was estimated (1) or directly observed (0).\n\n\n2.1.4 Format:\nThe dataset is structured with observations for each country-year combination, represented through 11 key variables. It is available in JSON and CSV formats, which can be transformed into tabular structures for analysis using tools like Python, R, or SQL.\n\n\n2.1.5 Frequency of Updates:\nThe WFSO dataset is updated three times annually, aligning with the IMF’s World Economic Outlook and FAO reports, ensuring timeliness and relevance.\n\n\n2.1.6 Data Access and Cleaning:\nThe World Food Security Outlook (WFSO) dataset is accessible through the World Bank’s API, which allows efficient retrieval and integration of data for analysis. The dataset includes 21,010 observations, providing insights into global food insecurity trends from 1999 to 2028. The API enables customized queries with parameters such as fields, filter, and limit to fetch specific variables or subsets of the data.\n\n\n2.1.7 API Endpoints:\n• Data: https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/api/tables/data/fcv/wfso\n• Metadata: https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/api/tables/info/fcv/wfso\nUsing R’s httr package, data was retrieved in chunks to handle the large dataset efficiently. The limit parameter was set to 5,000 rows per request, and the offset parameter was iteratively adjusted to fetch subsequent rows. This method ensured efficient access to the entire dataset while adhering to API constraints.\n\n\n2.1.8 Importing the Data:\nUsing R’s httr package, the data was fetched incrementally in chunks of 5,000 rows to handle the large dataset.

While the WFSO dataset is well-structured, missing values can occur due to data collection challenges, especially in global datasets with diverse sources. Identifying and addressing these gaps is a critical step in ensuring reliable analysis.\n\n2.2.1 Missing Value Summary\nTo begin, we first assess the dataset for missing values across all variables. This involves counting the number of rows and columns with missing data and calculating the percentage of missing values for each variable. This analysis provides an overview of the data quality and highlights areas that may require imputation or exclusion.\nHere’s how the missing values are summarized:\n• Check for missing values in each column.\n• Identify the percentage of missing data for each variable.\n• Determine whether missingness is concentrated in specific variables (e.g., numerical vs. categorical) or is distributed across the dataset.",
