# Introduction
This project explores global food insecurity by analyzing data trends and patterns to understand the prevalence and drivers of severe food insecurity across 191 countries. As a critical global challenge shaped by economic, social, and environmental factors, addressing food insecurity is essential for public health, economic stability, and sustainable development.

Using the World Food Security Outlook (WFSO) dataset, which integrates data from key sources like FAO, IMF, and FEWS NET, this project examines historical trends, current conditions, and future projections related to severe food insecurity. Advanced machine learning models, such as Cubist regression, enhance data accuracy and provide robust insights into regional disparities and macroeconomic factors influencing food security.

By leveraging these analyses, this project aims to contribute to discussions on policy and strategy development, supporting global efforts to reduce hunger and promote sustainable development.

## Background
Food insecurity is defined as inconsistent access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food for an active, healthy life. Severe food insecurity—where individuals go days without eating—reflects economic instability, social inequality, and environmental challenges. Addressing food insecurity is essential to achieving the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of Zero Hunger by 2030, as it directly impacts poverty, public health, and climate resilience.

Recent global crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, conflicts in regions like Ukraine, and climate-related disasters, have exacerbated food insecurity. These events highlight the urgency of informed analysis to address this critical challenge.

## Objectives
The project aims to uncover meaningful patterns and trends in global food insecurity, guided by the following key questions:

How has severe food insecurity evolved globally and regionally from 1999 to the present?
Which regions or countries are at the highest risk?
How do macroeconomic factors like inflation and economic shocks impact food insecurity?
What are the financing needs and demographic trends among food-insecure populations?

## Contribution
This project leverages the WFSO dataset to provide actionable insights into food insecurity trends, informing strategies for resource allocation and policy development. By raising awareness of systemic issues tied to food security, the analysis contributes to fostering global resilience and progress toward achieving Zero Hunger.
